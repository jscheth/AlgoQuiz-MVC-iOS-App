# AlgoQuiz - MVC iOS App

AlgoQuiz is a learning app built using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern in Swift. This app is designed to help users test their knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through an interactive quiz format. It leverages Swift features such as structures, mutating functions, methods, properties, and auto layout for a seamless user experience.

## Features
- **MVC Architecture:** Proper separation of concerns using the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- **Swift Structs:** Data is managed using structures with mutating methods.
- **Dynamic Quiz Logic:** Questions and answers are stored in a struct-based model.
- **User Interaction:** Users can answer true/false questions and receive immediate feedback.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the user’s progress and score.
- **Auto Layout:** Fully responsive UI built using Swift’s Auto Layout.
